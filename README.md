# ML_LinearReg_Calibration
Calibration is done in Nuclear Physis to convert "raw" data to appropriate units. While calibrating Silicon detectors, adc value is the raw data, which should to converted to energy of particle (MeV units). This script implements Linear Regression to automatically handle the conversion from adc-value to energy.
